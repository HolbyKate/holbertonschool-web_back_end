Caching:

Caching in Python is an optimisation technique that consists of temporarily storing the results of calculations or costly operations in fast memory (dictionary, file, database, etc.) so that they can be reused later without having to be recalculated. This considerably speeds up the performance of applications, particularly those involving heavy processing or frequent access to remote data. The main caching strategies are FIFO, LIFO, LRU, LFU, etc. The standard library provides basic tools, while third-party libraries such as cached-property or cacheout offer advanced functionality.
